# Dataset of Focused waves (DeepCwind)
This dataset contains the information to enforce the reproducibility of the results presented in Section 5 of the paper "Numerical investigation of a semi-submersible floating offshore wind turbine platform interacting with ocean waves using an SPH framework"

The two folders contain the information that are necessary to generate the focused wave trains described in Table 6 and Table 7. The files are named accordigly to the case they refer to. Each file has three columns.


| time [s] | position [m] | elevation xf [m] |
